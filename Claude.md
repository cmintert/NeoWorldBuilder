# NeoWorldBuilder - Claude's Understanding

## Current Task: MapTab Refactoring

### Problem
The `map_tab.py` file is 1562 lines long and has become difficult to maintain. Previous refactoring attempts broke functionality, so we need a careful approach that preserves all existing behavior.

### Refactoring Plan

#### 1. MapToolbarManager (map_toolbar_manager.py)
- Extract toolbar creation methods (_create_image_controls, _create_zoom_controls)
- Manage button states and styling
- Handle toolbar-specific signals
- **Size reduction**: ~100 lines

#### 2. MapModeManager (map_mode_manager.py)
- Extract all toggle_* methods (pin, line, branching line, edit mode)
- Manage mode state flags
- Handle mode transitions and exclusivity
- **Size reduction**: ~200 lines

#### 3. MapEventHandler (map_event_handler.py)
- Extract event handling methods (_handle_coordinate_click, handle_viewport_key_press, etc.)
- Manage keyboard and mouse event processing
- Handle event filter logic
- **Size reduction**: ~400 lines

#### 4. MapFeatureLoader (map_feature_loader.py)
- Extract load_features method
- Extract _extract_target_node helper
- Handle feature data parsing from relationships table
- **Size reduction**: ~100 lines

#### 5. MapBranchCreationHandler (map_branch_creation_handler.py)
- Extract all branch creation methods
- Handle branch creation state management
- Manage branch creation mode and completion
- **Size reduction**: ~300 lines

#### 6. MapCoordinateUtilities (map_coordinate_utilities.py)
- Extract coordinate finding methods (_find_nearest_line_at_position, _find_nearest_control_point)
- Extract _point_to_line_distance calculation
- Other geometry utilities
- **Size reduction**: ~150 lines

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create each new class as a helper that MapTab delegates to
2. Pass necessary references (self, controller, etc.) to helper classes
3. Maintain exact same public interface on MapTab
4. Test after each extraction to ensure nothing breaks
5. Use composition pattern - MapTab owns instances of helper classes

### Expected Result
- MapTab reduced from 1562 to ~600-700 lines
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and testing
- No functional changes visible to rest of application

## Project Overview

**NeoWorldBuilder** is a sophisticated worldbuilding tool designed for creative writers, game designers, and storytellers. It uses a graph database approach to organize and interconnect creative ideas, making complex fictional worlds more manageable and explorable.

### Core Philosophy
The application is built around four fundamental concepts:
1. **Names** - Every element starts with a unique identifier
2. **Descriptions** - Rich textual content that brings ideas to life  
3. **Labels** - Categorical classification (Characters, Locations, Events, etc.)
4. **Relations** - Meaningful connections that create narrative coherence

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: PyQt6-based desktop application with custom UI components
- **Backend**: Neo4j graph database for data persistence
- **Language**: Python 3.13+ with modern async patterns
- **Packaging**: PyInstaller for distribution (.spec file present)

### Architectural Patterns
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service classes
- **Worker-Based Threading**: Async database operations using PyQt6 QThread workers
- **Observer Pattern**: Signal/slot communication throughout the UI
- **Configuration Management**: Multi-environment config system with inheritance

## Key Systems

### 1. Database Architecture (`src/core/`)
- **Neo4jModel**: Main database gateway with connection management
- **Worker Classes**: Separate workers for Query, Write, Delete, and Suggestion operations
- **Project Isolation**: All nodes tagged with `_project` property for multi-project support
- **System Properties**: Automatic tracking of `_created`, `_modified`, `_author` metadata
- **Relationship Management**: Bidirectional relationship handling with "stump" node creation

### 2. Configuration System (`src/config/`)
- **Environment-Aware**: Development vs production configuration isolation
- **Hierarchical**: JSON-based configs with inheritance and override capability
- **Security**: Encrypted password storage with auto-generated encryption keys
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for Neo4j names and data structures

### 3. Service Layer (`src/services/`)
Key services include:
- **LLMService**: AI-powered suggestions and content generation
- **NameCacheService**: Performance optimization for autocomplete
- **WorkerManagerService**: Centralized thread/worker lifecycle management
- **AutocompletionService**: Smart name matching and suggestions
- **PropertyService**: Dynamic property management
- **RelationshipTreeService**: Hierarchical relationship visualization

### 4. UI Architecture (`src/ui/`)
- **Controller Pattern**: Centralized business logic in WorldBuildingController
- **Component System**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- **Provider Pattern**: Data providers for complex UI interactions
- **Mixin Architecture**: Shared behavior through mixins

## Data Model

### Node Structure
```python
node = {
    "name": str,              # Unique identifier
    "description": str,       # Rich text content
    "tags": List[str],        # User-defined tags
    "labels": List[str],      # Categorical classifications
    "additional_properties": Dict[str, Any],  # Dynamic properties
    "relationships": List[Tuple],  # Connected nodes
    # System properties (auto-managed):
    "_created": ISO timestamp,
    "_modified": ISO timestamp, 
    "_author": str,
    "_project": str
}
```

### Relationship Model
- **Bidirectional**: Relationships can be traversed in both directions
- **Typed**: Each relationship has a semantic type (e.g., "KNOWS", "LOCATED_IN")
- **Property-Rich**: Relationships can carry additional metadata
- **Stump Nodes**: Auto-creation of placeholder nodes for incomplete references
