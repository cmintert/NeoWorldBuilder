### Click Propagation Fix: Z-Order Aware Hit Testing (2025-07-06)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/feature_manager.py` - Added z-order tracking and priority-based hit testing
- `src/ui/components/map_component/containers/pin_container.py` - Enhanced mouse event handling with z-order awareness
- `src/ui/components/map_component/containers/line_container.py` - Enhanced mouse event handling with z-order awareness
- `src/ui/components/map_component/map_viewport.py` - Added feature priority checking before coordinate emission

**Files Added:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/z_order_hit_tester.py` - Z-order aware hit testing with feature priority
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/precise_hit_tester.py` - Precise geometric hit testing (no bounding box)

**Problem Solved:**
- **Navigation Failure**: Pins behind line bounding boxes now navigate correctly
- **Event Stealing**: Line containers no longer steal clicks intended for pins
- **Edit Mode Issues**: Line editing works through overlapping features
- **Z-Order Mismatches**: Visual layering now matches event processing order

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Z-Order Tracking**: Feature manager tracks creation order and widget stacking
- **Priority System**: Pins (priority 100) > Control Points (90) > Line Segments (50) > Labels (30)
- **Precise Hit Testing**: Uses actual geometry instead of widget bounding boxes
- **Event Propagation**: Features check priority before claiming events
- **Coordinate Emission**: Viewport only emits coordinate clicks when no feature claims priority

**Key Improvements:**
- Reliable navigation to pins even when behind line features
- Proper line editing with overlapping bounding boxes
- Z-order aware event processing matches visual layering
- Precise geometric hit testing eliminates false positives
- Configurable feature priorities for different interaction modes

### Bug Fix: Geometry Method Name Conflict (2025-07-06)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/precise_hit_tester.py` - Fixed name conflict between Qt widget geometry() and line geometry attribute

**Problem Solved:**
- **TypeError**: `'UnifiedLineGeometry' object is not callable` when testing click propagation
- **Name Conflict**: LineContainer.geometry attribute shadowed QWidget.geometry() method

**Solution:**
- Used `QWidget.geometry(widget)` instead of `widget.geometry()` to avoid attribute shadowing
- Maintained clear separation between Qt widget geometry (QRect) and line geometric data (UnifiedLineGeometry)

**Testing Results:**
- Click propagation testing now works without errors
- Z-order aware hit testing functions correctly
- Navigation through overlapping features restored

### Bug Fix: Missing target_node in Hit Results (2025-07-06)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/z_order_hit_tester.py` - Added target_node to enhanced hit results and safety checks

**Problem Solved:**
- **KeyError**: `'target_node'` when accessing hit result data in logging
- **Missing Data**: Enhanced hit results lacked target_node information

**Solution:**
- Added `target_node = getattr(feature, 'target_node', 'unknown')` to _enhance_hit_result method
- Replaced direct dict access with `.get()` calls for safer logging
- Ensured all hit results have required keys for debugging

**Testing Results:**
- Hit testing logging now works without KeyErrors
- Safe fallback values prevent crashes during debugging
- Z-order system fully functional with comprehensive logging

### Feature Enhancement: Multi-Event Priority System (2025-07-06)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/feature_manager.py` - Added hover and drag event priority methods
- `src/ui/components/map_component/containers/pin_container.py` - Enhanced event handling with event type awareness
- `src/ui/components/map_component/containers/line_container.py` - Enhanced event handling with event type awareness

**Files Added:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/interaction_priority_manager.py` - Sophisticated event priority management

**Problem Solved:**
- **Missing Hover Events**: Cursor changes and line editing didn't work due to overly strict priority system
- **Edit Mode Blocked**: Line control points couldn't be hovered or edited when pins were nearby
- **Single Event Type**: Previous system treated all mouse events the same way

**Solution:**
- **Event Type Differentiation**: Separate priority handling for click, hover, and drag events
- **Permissive Hover System**: Lower priority threshold (40) for hover events vs strict clicks (80)
- **Smart Edit Mode**: Line editing gets priority for hover events to enable control point manipulation
- **Contextual Priorities**: Different features get bonuses based on interaction type

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Click Events**: Strict priority - pins win for navigation
- **Hover Events**: Permissive priority - lines can show edit cursors even behind pins  
- **Drag Events**: Continuation priority - ongoing drags maintain control
- **Priority Adjustments**: +20 for pins on clicks, +10 for lines on hover, +30 for drag operations

**Key Improvements:**
- Navigation clicks go to pins (high priority)
- Edit mode hover works on lines (lower threshold)
- Drag operations maintain control once started
- Cursor changes work correctly for all features
- Line editing fully functional through overlapping features

### Bug Fix: Zero Priority for Line Features (2025-07-06)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/z_order_hit_tester.py` - Added missing 'line' priority mapping and debug logging
- `src/ui/components/map_component/utils/interaction_priority_manager.py` - Enhanced debug logging for threshold checking

**Problem Solved:**
- **Zero Priority**: Line features were getting 0 priority instead of 50, blocking all hover interactions
- **Missing Mapping**: FEATURE_PRIORITIES had 'line_segment' but hit_type was 'line'
- **Threshold Failure**: Priority 0 < hover threshold 40, so all hover events failed

**Solution:**
- Added `'line': 50` to FEATURE_PRIORITIES dictionary to match actual hit_type values
- Enhanced debug logging to catch priority lookup failures
- Added threshold value to debug output for easier troubleshooting

**Testing Results:**
- Line features now get priority 50 (above hover threshold 40)
- Hover events should now work correctly for line editing
- Debug output shows priority calculation details for troubleshooting
