# QGraphicsView Migration Plan: Map Component Architecture Overhaul

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive migration strategy from the current widget-based map system to Qt's QGraphicsView framework. This migration will resolve fundamental issues with overlapping widgets, event propagation, and z-order management while providing a more scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture Problems
1. **Widget Overlap Issues**: Line and pin widgets have overlapping bounding boxes causing event interference
2. **Complex Event Handling**: Manual z-order priority systems that fight Qt's natural event flow
3. **Performance Concerns**: Many overlapping widgets with individual event handlers
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Complex hit testing, priority management, and event forwarding code
5. **Scalability Limits**: System becomes unwieldy with many map features

### Current Component Structure
```
MapTab
├── MapViewport (QLabel) - Image display and coordinate tracking
├── FeatureManager - Widget lifecycle management
├── Container Widgets
│   ├── PinContainer (QWidget)
│   ├── LineContainer (QWidget) 
│   └── BranchingLineContainer (QWidget)
└── Hit Testing/Priority Systems
    ├── ZOrderHitTester
    ├── InteractionPriorityManager
    └── PreciseHitTester
```

## Target Architecture: QGraphicsView Framework

### Core Components
```
MapTab
├── QGraphicsView - Main viewport and interaction handling
├── QGraphicsScene - Coordinate space and item management
├── Graphics Items
│   ├── PinGraphicsItem (QGraphicsItem)
│   ├── LineGraphicsItem (QGraphicsItem)
│   └── BranchingLineGraphicsItem (QGraphicsItem)
└── Scene Manager - Simplified feature lifecycle
```

### QGraphicsView Benefits

- **Automatic Z-Order**: Scene manages item stacking with proper event propagation
- **Optimized Rendering**: Scene graph optimization for large numbers of items
- **Built-in Transformations**: Native zoom, pan, and coordinate transformations
- **Event System**: Proper event propagation from scene to items
- **Selection Framework**: Built-in selection and focus management

## Migration Strategy: Four-Phase Approach

        self.control_points = []
        self.setFlag(QGraphicsItem.ItemIsSelectable, True)
        
    def boundingRect(self) -> QRectF:
        # Precise line bounds with small margin
        
    def shape(self) -> QPainterPath:
        # Exact hit testing shape for line segments
        
    def paint(self, painter, option, widget):
        # Line rendering with control points in edit mode

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordinate System Management
```python
class CoordinateMapper:
    """Handles conversion between different coordinate systems."""
    
    def scene_to_original(self, scene_pos: QPointF) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Convert scene coordinates to original image coordinates."""
        
    def original_to_scene(self, orig_x: int, orig_y: int) -> QPointF:
        """Convert original coordinates to scene coordinates."""
        
    def widget_to_scene(self, widget_pos: QPoint) -> QPointF:
        """Convert widget coordinates to scene coordinates."""
```

### Signal Compatibility Layer
```python
class GraphicsFeatureManager(QObject):
    """Maintains signal compatibility with existing feature manager."""
    
    # Existing signals preserved
    feature_clicked = pyqtSignal(str)
    feature_created = pyqtSignal(str, str)
    geometry_changed = pyqtSignal(str, list)
    
    def __init__(self, scene: QGraphicsScene):
        self.scene = scene
        self._setup_scene_connections()
        
    def _setup_scene_connections(self):
        """Connect scene events to legacy signals."""
```

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
```python
class LegacyMapTabAdapter:
    """Provides backward compatibility during migration."""
    
    def __init__(self, legacy_map_tab, graphics_view):
        self.legacy = legacy_map_tab
        self.graphics = graphics_view
        self._bridge_interfaces()
        
    def _bridge_interfaces(self):
        """Bridge calls between old and new systems."""
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
